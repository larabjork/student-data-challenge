# Student Data Challenge
Data Bootcamp - Week 4 Challenge assignment (Pandas)

## Project Overview
This exercise used data from a city school district on school funding and high school students' standardized test scores. The goal was to aggregate data and examine it for patterns in school performance.

The process involved:
* collecting the data from a .csv file, 
* preparing the data by removing records that had at least one missing value, 
* further preparing the data by removing duplicate records, 
* calculating summary statistics, and 
* looking at subsets of the whole data set.

## Summary of Analysis
Many patterns can be detected from the analyses that were conducted, including the following partial list:
* The mean reading score for 11th and 12th graders (combined) is higher than for 9th graders. 
* The mean school budget for public high schools is higher than that of charter high schools ($911,196 versus $872,626).
* School size varies widely, with Montgomery High School having the maximum number of students included in this analysis (2,038 students) versus the minimum number of students at Chang High School (171 students).
* Comparing mean math scores by grade for each school type shows that, on average:
    * 9th and 11th graders at charter schools performed  better than their public school counterparts, 
    * 10th graders performed almost the same across school type, and 
    * 12th graders at public schools performed better than their charter school counterparts.

## Additional Possible Analyses
Many additional questions could be explored within this data set, such as:

* Are there schools that account for most of the missing and/or duplicated data, or is the data that was excluded from analysis fairly evenly distributed?
* How does total budget relate to student count? What is the per-student budget by school? By type of school (charter versus public)?
* For each time that a specific mean was calculated, a comparable analysis of the median value and the interquartile range would be helpful to better understand the data's distribution and the presence of outliers.
